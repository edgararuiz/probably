## 0.0.3 Resubmission

### Review 1

I had an incorrectly specified Authors@R + Maintainer field combination. That
has been fixed.

## 0.0.3 Submission

This patch release is for compatibility with vctrs 0.2.0.

This also changes the maintainer to Davis, as he has taken over regular 
maintanence of the package.
