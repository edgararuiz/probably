\usage{
cal_binary_plot_breaks(
  .data,
  truth,
  estimate,
  num_breaks = 10,
  conf_level = 0.9,
  include_ribbon = TRUE,
  include_rug = TRUE
)

cal_binary_plot_logistic(
  .data,
  truth,
  estimate,
  conf_level = 0.9,
  include_rug = TRUE,
  include_ribbon = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data.frame object containing predictions and probability columns}

\item{truth}{The column identifier for the true class results
(that is a factor). This should be an unquoted column name}

\item{estimate}{The column identifier for the prediction probabilities.
This should be an unquoted column name}

\item{num_breaks}{The number of segments to group the probabilities. Defaults
to 10}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level to use in the visualization. Applies to
the ribbon layer. Defaults to 0.9}

\item{include_ribbon}{Flag that indicates if the ribbon layer is to be
included. Defaults to \code{TRUE}}

\item{include_rug}{Flag that indicates if the Rug layer is to be included.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}}
}
\description{
Calibration plot functions. They require a data.frame that contains
the predictions and probability columns. The output is a \code{ggplot2} graph.
